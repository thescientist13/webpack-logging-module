# webpack-logging-module

## Overview
Repo for designing / creating a logging utility for webpack, per this issue [discussion](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/issues/87).

> Make a logger module for webpack instead of manually configuring this. ( Useful for both the CLI and webpack itself )

Additional feedback / direction I've been provided around designing the API has been documented [here](https://github.com/thescientist13/webpack-logging-module/issues/1)
